# rig2c

rig2c is a software library enabling applications to use rigs generated by [kp2rig](kp2rig.md).
Most developers won't use this directly (but you certainly can), and will instead choose a higher-level API that wraps it, including:
 - rig2cs, for Unity, Universal Windows Platform (UWP), custom C# application
 - rig2py, an importable python module for python >= 3.5
 - [rig2blender](/doc/rig2blender.md) for Blender >=2.80
 - rig2maya
